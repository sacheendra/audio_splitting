Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

`pydub` requires ffmpeg or libav. Install one of them from your OS's package repository or from source. Check [https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) for more info. This is the library used to read audio files.

Finally open the ipynb file in jupter, add the file paths you want and run. 

The results files will be save in the current working directory with the same name as the input file.
